[IEEEXtreme](https://ieeextreme.org/) is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. In this __repository__, you will find the __Problemset__ and some __Solutions__ of IEEEXtreme 10.0 .
